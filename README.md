# How-to-do-FEV-Analysis
This page is intended for general public. It provides a step by step guide on how to repeat the work completed in this repository for any river and location in the UK of your choice. 
## 1.Download Anaconda for free to get access to Spyder
Spyder is an open source data handling programme which uses Python language. https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
## 2.Pick a flood to study
This could be a flood event which affected you or one which you saw in the news. Take note of the month and year that this flood took place in. 
## 3.Pick a location to study
Once you've determined the flood event you're interested in, you need to know which City/Town/Village you're interested in studying. 
You then need to pick a river monitoring station. This would ideally be close to your location of interest. Here is a map of the river monitoring stations in the UK. https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/river-and-sea-levels
